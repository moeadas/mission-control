# Mission Control — Architecture

## Overview

Mission Control is a Next.js 16.2.1-based agency management application designed to orchestrate virtual AI agents through configurable workflows. The system follows a config-first philosophy where all business logic is stored as editable JSON.

Current practical model:
- the live app manages clients, tasks, outputs, and Iris chat
- the config layer manages skills, pipelines, workflows, tools, and templates
- task execution now supports autonomous multi-agent runs inside the chat request lifecycle
- when a suitable pipeline exists, the task runner executes activities phase by phase and passes outputs between agents
- outputs are rendered in the app as designed HTML artifacts and can still be exported as DOCX, PDF, or XLSX
- Iris intelligence is now driven by a shared deliverable registry instead of separate first-match keyword lists
- Iris chat now has a client-side pending-brief state machine for missing intake fields, so follow-up answers advance a live brief instead of being misread as brand-new tasks
- authenticated app-state sync no longer pushes `conversations` back to the server on every message change, so live Iris briefing state is not destabilized by background rehydration during intake
- pending Iris briefs are now treated as local ephemeral UI state for server sync purposes and are restored from the local Zustand store after chat-shell remounts, so a session refresh or shell re-render does not bounce the intake flow back to question one
- missions now seed an initial squad from the shared deliverable registry as soon as Iris locks the brief, and the chat polls task execution state during active runs so progress, current phase, and office activity do not stay frozen at the initial client placeholder
- `/api/chat` now bootstraps a real relational `tasks` row plus `task_assignments` as soon as a briefed mission starts execution, so signed-in live runs can be polled immediately instead of waiting for a later shared-state sync
- workflow updates now also mirror progress/status back onto the `tasks` row, and client hydration preserves recent in-flight local missions if a stale `/api/state` payload arrives mid-run
- built-in pipelines now prefer the on-disk config definitions over stale database copies, which keeps structured-output metadata like batching and JSON contracts current during live execution
- Iris chat only persists outputs when the response clears the quality gate, so broken partials and routing boilerplate do not masquerade as deliverables in the Outputs view
- the dashboard and mission console now expose a lightweight game loop:
  - urgency
  - next best action
  - reward framing
  - mission complexity
  - routing confidence

## Shared Deliverable Intelligence

The app now has a shared deliverable intelligence layer in:

- `src/lib/deliverables.ts`

This registry is the single source of truth for:

- deliverable IDs and labels
- deliverable category
- inference patterns and scoring priority
- default lead and collaborator agents
- pipeline hints
- complexity level

Consumers now aligned to this registry:

- `src/lib/server/ai.ts`
- `src/lib/server/task-channeling.ts`
- `src/lib/agents-store.ts`
- `src/lib/task-output.ts`
- `src/lib/output-quality.ts`
- `src/lib/bot-animations.ts`

Practical effect:

- Iris classifies more natural request shapes like short-form descriptions, email campaigns, website copy, blog articles, scripts, decks, brand guidelines, PR/comms, event plans, and analytics work
- client-side mission creation and server-side routing now agree much more often
- routing now returns confidence and collaborator context instead of only a single lead agent

## Iris Intelligence Flow

The current task intelligence flow is:

1. User prompt enters Iris chat or mission creation
2. `deliverables.ts` scores the prompt and resolves a deliverable type
3. If the request needs more intake data, `iris-briefing.ts` opens a pending brief in the client and collects the missing fields with typed answers or clickable options
4. The active brief is mirrored into the local store so Iris can recover the same question step even if the chat shell remounts during the intake flow
5. Once complete, Iris composes a confirmed brief and starts the task from that enriched request
6. `ai.ts` builds routing context:
  - lead agent
  - collaborators
  - pipeline hint
  - confidence
7. `task-channeling.ts` builds the skill stack and orchestration trace
8. `task-output.ts` defines the expected output structure and quality checklist
9. `output-quality.ts` validates that the result matches the expected deliverable shape

This is the main reason Iris now behaves more like an agency-aware AI model rather than a generic chat wrapper.

## Gamified UX Layer

Gamification is intentionally tied to real operational state rather than decorative counters.

Primary files:

- `src/lib/live-ops.ts`
- `src/components/dashboard/MetricsCards.tsx`
- `src/components/tasks/GlobalTaskTracker.tsx`
- `src/components/analytics/AgentLeaderboardPanel.tsx`

Current game-loop elements:

- `CommandQuestDeck` on the dashboard:
  - shows next-best actions
  - frames actions as quests
  - exposes visible reward labels
- `MissionQueue`:
  - shows next action
  - shows reward label
  - shows mission complexity
  - shows routing confidence
- `GlobalTaskTracker` mission console:
  - shows complexity
  - shows routing confidence
  - shows reward framing
  - shows next-action guidance
- `buildAgentLeaderboard` in `live-ops.ts` now rewards:
  - completed work
  - lead wins
  - support wins
  - rescue / blocker work
  - quality wins
  - impact from mission complexity and confidence

Design rule:

- progress visuals should be backed by real mission state whenever possible
- the app should feel playful and rewarding without lying about execution progress

## Configuration Files

### Core Configs

| File/Directory | Purpose |
|----------------|---------|
| `src/lib/agent-templates.ts` | Agent definitions (DEFAULT_AGENTS array) |
| `src/config/agents/*.json` | Individual agent configs (backup/reference) |
| `src/config/pipelines/*.json` | Individual pipeline configs |
| `src/config/skills/*.json` | Individual skill files (~140 skills) |
| `src/config/tools/tools-config.json` | Tool registry |

## Page Structure

| Route | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `/dashboard` | Main command center with agency stats, agent strip, activity feed |
| `/office` | Minimal virtual office workspace with seated active agents and roaming idle agents |
| `/agents` | Agent roster with edit modal |
| `/clients` | Client management |
| `/tasks` | Task list and mission tracking |
| `/pipeline` | Pipeline templates browser |
| `/pipeline/[id]` | Pipeline editor |
| `/pipeline/run` | Pipeline execution runner |
| `/skills` | Skills library browser |
| `/skills/[id]` | Individual skill editor |
| `/analytics` | Analytics dashboards |
| `/outputs` | Saved deliverables |
| `/settings` | App settings with OAuth integrations |
| `/settings/integrations` | OAuth integrations (Google, Meta) |
| `/config` | JSON config editor |

## Virtual Office

The `/office` page now uses a lighter minimalist workspace inspired by isometric office layouts rather than the older game-map treatment.

### Features
- Top-down 2D floor-map layout with a simplified, calmer floor-plan treatment inspired by retro office maps
- Division rooms for Orchestration, Client Services, Creative, Media, and Research
- Active and paused agents sit inside their assigned rooms
- Idle agents roam through the central hall using smoother looping motion paths instead of stepped pixel movement
- Clicking a room focuses that division and shows its roster
- Clicking an agent opens a live detail panel for that person
- Uses the shared avatar renderer, so uploaded agent photos appear automatically in the office
- Office avatars use a frameless variant so uploaded PNG portraits sit directly on the map without rounded card containers
- The room roster/detail panel lives in a dedicated right-side rail so it does not cover the main floor
- Rooms show only division names and counts, not descriptive subtitles
- Furniture and decor are rendered as simple desks, chairs, lounge seating, and plants to keep the map readable without feeling empty
- The office map is arranged around a calmer central commons so the floor reads more like a natural top-view studio plan than a floating widget layout

### Room Configuration
Each room has:
- Position coordinates (x, y, width, height)
- Division color for visual identification
- Agent avatars placed within
- Agent count indicator

## State Management

### Agents Store (`agents-store.ts`)
Manages:
- `agents[]` - All 10 agency agents (loaded from DEFAULT_AGENTS)
- `missions[]` - Active tasks/projects
- `clients[]` - Client profiles
- `conversations[]` - Chat history with Iris
- `providerSettings` - Ollama/Gemini configuration
- `agencySettings` - Theme, defaults
- `artifacts[]` - Saved output registry
- execution metadata on tasks:
  - `leadAgentId`
  - `collaboratorAgentIds`
  - `pipelineId`
  - `pipelineName`
  - `qualityChecklist`
  - `handoffNotes`

Persistence: Zustand with localStorage (persists agents, missions, clients, etc.)

Artifact compatibility notes:

- Older artifact records are normalized on hydration so the Outputs screen can safely render mixed legacy/current data
- Missing artifact fields now default to:
  - `deliverableType: client-brief`
  - `status: draft`
  - `format: html`
- Older `executionPrompt` values are folded into `sourcePrompt` during hydration
- This prevents the Outputs route from crashing when shared state contains artifacts created before the current output schema

### Shared Persistence (Supabase Migration In Progress)

The app now uses a hybrid shared persistence model.

- Local Zustand persistence still exists as a browser fallback/cache
- Shared runtime state is exposed through `src/app/api/state/route.ts`
- Server-side Supabase access is wrapped in:
  - `src/lib/supabase/config.ts`
  - `src/lib/supabase/server.ts`
  - `src/lib/supabase/app-state.ts`
  - `src/lib/supabase/relational-sync.ts`
- The bridge migration stores the full agency snapshot in `mission_control_state`
- The bridge SQL migration lives at `supabase/migrations/20260325_create_mission_control_state.sql`
- `ClientShell` now:
  - hydrates the app from `/api/state` on load
  - sends bearer-authenticated sync writes back to `/api/state`
  - sets `appStateReady` so direct links wait for shared state hydration
  - self-heals `409 Conflict` sync races by refetching the latest shared state and rehydrating the store instead of silently drifting

### Relational Supabase Schema (Now Started)

The proper relational schema migration now exists at:

- `supabase/migrations/20260325_create_mission_control_relational_core.sql`

This migration introduces first-class tables for:

- `agencies`
- `agents`
- `clients`
- `skills`
- `agent_skill_links`
- `pipelines`
- `tasks`
- `task_assignments`
- `task_runs`
- `outputs`
- `conversations`
- `messages`
- `workflow_instances`
- `knowledge_assets`
- `profiles`

It also creates storage buckets for:

- `agent-avatars`
- `knowledge-docs`
- `task-exports`
- `creative-assets`

Important status note:

- Snapshot saves still exist as a bridge, but runtime reads for core entities now come from relational tables first
- Snapshot saves also write through to the relational Supabase tables
- Core entities currently synced from runtime state:
  - `agents`
  - `clients`
  - `tasks`
  - `task_assignments`
  - `outputs`
  - `conversations`
  - `messages`
  - `knowledge_assets`
- Agency-wide settings still bridge through `agencies.settings` / snapshot merge:
  - `agencySettings`
  - `providerSettings`
  - `campaigns`

## State Sync Model

Mission Control now uses a hybrid but more granular sync model:

- browser-local Zustand persistence is only a fast structural cache
- shared state still has a full snapshot row for recovery
- core mutable collections now sync as entity deltas:
  - `agents`
  - `clients`
  - `missions`
  - `artifacts`
  - `conversations`
- each client sync computes:
  - per-record `upserts`
  - per-record `deletes`
  - smaller top-level `statePatch` updates for settings-like data
- relational Supabase tables are updated from those deltas so the backend is no longer dependent on full-state overwrite behavior

Conflict handling:

- `/api/state` rejects stale writes with `409 Conflict`
- `ClientShell` responds by re-fetching the latest shared state and hydrating the local store, rather than continuing with a stale snapshot

## Task Execution Model

Task execution now has three layers:

1. **Direct chat execution**
   - Iris can still execute work during the original `/api/chat` request
   - execution steps, provider info, and quality outcomes are written onto the task/output records

2. **Persisted execution state**
   - `workflow_instances` stores the latest task workflow status, phase, and progress
   - `task_runs` stores discrete execution-stage events with timestamps and status

3. **Retry / resume execution route**
   - `/api/tasks/[id]/execution` supports `GET` for live execution state and `POST` for retry/resume actions
  - execution is queued through `src/lib/server/execution-queue.ts`
  - queue state is now persisted through `task_runs` entries with stage `execution-job` instead of an in-memory `Map`
  - this makes live execution status durable across UI polling and removes the old memory-only queue state
  - the dispatcher still runs in-process today, so a true detached worker remains a future infrastructure upgrade

Task detail UI now surfaces:

- workflow status
- current phase
- execution progress
- runner/job status
- recent run history
- richer autonomous execution audit steps
  - `activities`
  - `agentMemories`
- `skills` and `pipelines` are now database-backed catalogs for both editor reads/writes and server-side runtime loading
- Config JSON remains seed/fallback content only when the database tables are empty

### Auth And Access

- Authentication now uses Supabase Auth as the app entry gate
- Browser session management uses `src/lib/supabase/browser.ts`
- `src/components/auth/SessionGate.tsx` blocks the app when no Supabase session exists and redirects unauthenticated users to `/login`
- `src/app/login/page.tsx` performs a **hard post-login redirect** to `/dashboard?refresh=...` so successful sign-in always loads a fresh document instead of relying on a potentially stale client bundle after rebuilds
- `src/app/api/auth/session/route.ts` verifies the Supabase access token and upserts a `profiles` row
- `moeadas@yahoo.com` is elevated to `super_admin`
- `/api/state`, `/api/skills`, and `/api/pipelines` all require a bearer token
- Admin-only route prefixes are:
  - `/settings`
  - `/config`
  - `/skills`
  - `/pipeline`
  - `/users`
- The sidebar hides those admin surfaces for non-admin users
- `/api/state` applies ownership filtering for non-admin users and preserves global configuration on scoped saves
- Ownership fields are being added to:
  - `clients.ownerUserId`
  - `missions.ownerUserId`
  - `artifacts.ownerUserId`
  - `conversations.ownerUserId`
- Non-admin users only receive their own clients/tasks/outputs/conversations from the shared state API
- Non-admin saves only update their owned records; shared/global state is preserved server-side
- `currentUser` is now tracked in the client store so new clients, tasks, outputs, and conversations inherit the authenticated owner id by default

### Admin User Management

- Super admin now has a dedicated `/users` page
- Admin APIs:
  - `GET /api/admin/users`
  - `POST /api/admin/users`
  - `PATCH /api/admin/users`
  - `POST /api/admin/backfill-ownership`
  - `POST /api/admin/assignments`
- The Users page can:
  - inspect workspace users and roles
  - create direct users with a temporary password
  - send Supabase email invites
  - change user role between `member` and `super_admin`
  - activate or suspend users
  - backfill legacy unowned records to the super admin
  - reassign client ownership
  - reassign task ownership
- Client/task reassignment cascades ownership to related outputs and conversations in Supabase
- `resolveAuthContextFromToken` now resolves role and active state from `profiles`, while reserving `moeadas@yahoo.com` as `super_admin`

### Shared State Readiness

- `ClientShell` loads shared state from `/api/state` on startup
- `appStateReady` is used by task/detail pages so direct URLs do not treat “state still hydrating” as “record not found”
- Persisted missions are normalized on hydration so older tasks missing newer fields like `assignedAgentIds` or `leadAgentId` can still open safely

### Supabase Environment

Required environment variables:

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`
- `SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY`

Current behavior:

- If those values are missing, the app falls back to browser-local persistence only
- Settings now shows whether shared persistence is connected or not configured
- Once connected, newly created tasks and other persisted agency state are written back through `/api/state` and can be seen across browsers

### Task Deletion

- Tasks can now be deleted from both the task list and the single task detail page
- Deleting a task also removes any artifacts linked to that task
- Store logic lives in `src/lib/agents-store.ts` via `deleteMission`

### Analytics Store
Manages:
- Campaign metrics
- Agent performance
- Learned patterns
- A/B tests

## Skills System

Skills are now stored in Supabase and edited through authenticated API routes:

- `GET /api/skills`
- `POST /api/skills`
- `GET /api/skills/[id]`
- `PUT /api/skills/[id]`
- `DELETE /api/skills/[id]`

The client-side skill library is backed by `src/lib/stores/skills-store.ts`, which loads from Supabase with the current bearer token. The JSON config under `src/config/skills` now acts as seed/fallback content, but the server runtime also merges full config definitions into DB-backed skills via `src/lib/server/skills-catalog.ts` so agents receive rich instructions, output templates, workflow steps, and checklists even when the database row began as a thin stub.

As of the latest hardening pass, the previously weak skill set has been rewritten so the current audit baseline is:

- `157` config skills reviewed
- `0` remaining below the minimum structural quality threshold used for instructions, output templates, checklist depth, and workflow-step coverage

### Skill Schema
Each skill row follows:
```typescript
interface Skill {
  id: string           // kebab-case unique ID
  name: string         // Display name
  description: string  // Third-person description
  category: string     // strategy|creative|media|research|operations|client-services|content
  difficulty: 'beginner' | 'intermediate' | 'advanced'
  freedom: 'high' | 'medium' | 'low'
  prompts: {
    en: { trigger, context, instructions, output_template }
    ar?: { ... }
  }
  variables: Array<{ name, type, required, description }>
  workflow?: { steps: Array<{ step, name, action, verify }> }
  examples?: Array<{ input, output }>
  checklist: string[]
  tools?: string[]

## AI Integration

### Providers
- **Ollama** - Local AI (default: `minimax-m2.7:cloud`)
- **Gemini** - Google Cloud AI

### Chat API
- Endpoint: `POST /api/chat`
- Features:
  - bearer-token authentication
  - client-context injection
  - deliverable inference
  - agent routing
  - pipeline inference
  - execution-plan generation
  - autonomous multi-agent execution
  - pipeline phase execution with role-to-agent mapping
  - skill-aware prompts per assigned agent
  - HTML artifact rendering payloads
  - no-hallucination output rules
- Iris is the default chat interface
- `/api/chat` now refuses unauthenticated requests, which closes the biggest compute-exposure route in the app

### Current Task Execution Logic

When a user gives Iris a task:
1. the client task is created immediately in the main store
2. the API infers:
   - deliverable type
   - lead agent
   - collaborator agents
   - optional pipeline hint
   - quality checklist
3. if a suitable pipeline exists, the autonomous runner executes pipeline phases in order:
   - each activity is mapped to the best-fit agent by role
   - that agent receives its assigned skills and tools in prompt context
   - activity outputs are stored and passed forward as handoff context
4. if no pipeline exists, collaborator agents produce specialist handoffs and the lead agent assembles the deliverable
5. the lead agent generates the actual deliverable, not a status note
6. the output is transformed into designed HTML for in-app viewing and saved as an artifact tied to that task
7. the task page shows:
   - request
   - visible output
   - execution prompt
   - team assignment
   - execution steps
   - quality steps
   - exports

- Client knowledge assets now feed directly into the main `/api/chat` client context block, so uploaded brand docs and research are no longer write-only metadata during generation

If the final lead-model pass returns no visible output:
- the server synthesizes a fallback deliverable from pipeline outputs and execution steps
- this guarantees the task still has a visible draft in the app

### Standalone Pipeline Runner Safeguards

- `src/lib/pipeline-execution.ts` is now a compatibility layer only:
  - routing preview
  - client field validation
  - tracked runner instance scaffolding
  - remote execution-state mapping
  - the old client-side execution exports now throw a deprecation error if called accidentally
- `createPipelineInstance()` seeds client data from the selected client profile, so the runner no longer starts with an empty prompt context
- `validatePipelineClientData()` now checks:
  - required `clientProfileFields`
  - all `{{template_variables}}` referenced in prompt templates and activity descriptions
- `/pipeline/run` now blocks execution and shows a setup error when the selected client is missing required pipeline data, instead of silently substituting `TBD`
- The standalone pipeline executor now injects:
  - assigned agent skill instructions and output-template hints
  - client knowledge asset summaries and extracted insights
- `executeActivityBatch()` now respects activity batching metadata (`batchSize` + `parallel`) so the runner can execute eligible activities in parallel slices instead of always forcing one-by-one execution
- Pipeline activity execution now carries richer execution-step metadata, including:
  - phase / activity identifiers
  - provider and model used
  - produced output ids
  - per-step quality issues when applicable

### How The Autonomous Runner Works

Main file:
- `src/lib/server/autonomous-task.ts`

Execution flow:
1. build a client profile map from the client brief context
2. select a matching pipeline when available
3. iterate each pipeline activity in sequence
4. map the activity role to a real agent
5. inject that agent's assigned skills and tools into the prompt
6. save the activity output into the pipeline output register
7. pass prior outputs into later phase prompts as handoff context
8. run the lead agent for final assembly
9. append a quality-control step from Iris

The execution trace is stored on the artifact as `executionSteps`, which powers the autonomous execution panels in Tasks and Outputs.
- Execution steps now function as a more explicit audit trail instead of just freeform summaries.

### HTML Output Logic

Main files:
- `src/lib/output-html.ts`
- `src/components/outputs/ArtifactOutputView.tsx`

How it works:
- the model is instructed to return structured content using `#` and `##` headings
- the server converts markdown-like structure into semantic HTML (`h1`, `h2`, `h3`, `p`, `ul`, `table`)
- the artifact stores both the source content and the rendered HTML
- task and output pages render the HTML view by default
- export services convert HTML back to plain text as needed for DOCX/PDF/XLSX generation

## Design Patterns

### Current Gaps To Keep In Mind

- Multiple config systems now coexist:
  - TypeScript agent templates
  - JSON agent role configs
  - JSON pipeline configs
  - JSON workflow configs
  This gives flexibility, but it also means contributor changes should be made carefully to avoid drift.

- Autonomous execution currently runs inside the request lifecycle, not as a detached background worker queue.
- That means long multi-phase tasks are slower but still synchronous from the user’s point of view.
- A future upgrade path would move `autonomous-task.ts` into persisted background jobs with resumable runs and real pause/cancel checkpoints.

### Card Design
- No accent stripes or gradients at top
- Clean border with subtle glow on hover
- Hover lift animation (translate-y)
- Strong shadow for depth

### Glass Morphism
```css
background: rgba(24, 24, 27, 0.8);
backdrop-filter: blur(12px);
border: 1px solid rgba(63, 63, 70, 0.5);
```

### Glow Effects
```css
box-shadow: 0 0 20px rgba(155, 109, 255, 0.3);
```

### Staggered Animations
```css
animation: fadeInUp 400ms ease-out forwards;
animation-delay: calc(var(--i) * 100ms);
```

## Agent Edit System

Agents are editable via the `/agents` page:
- Click any agent card to open edit modal
- Editable fields: name, role, bio, specialty, prompts, tools, skills, and personal photo
- Changes now flow through shared app state and are written into Supabase-backed tables
- Agent positions and statuses are also editable
- All UI components react to changes in real-time

### Agent Photo Logic

- `Agent.photoUrl` now stores a shared public path like `/uploads/agents/<file>`
- The shared avatar component is `src/components/agents/AgentBot.tsx`
- If `photoUrl` exists, the personal image is shown everywhere the agent appears
- If `photoUrl` is missing or fails to load, the app falls back to the default robot icon
- Photo upload and reset controls live in `src/components/agents/AgentEditor.tsx`
- The upload control uses a dedicated button wired to a visually hidden file input via `ref`, which is more reliable than styling the file input directly
- Uploaded avatar files are written to `public/uploads/agents`
- The shared server-side avatar map is stored in `data/agent-photos.json`
- `GET /api/agent-photos` hydrates avatar URLs into the client store on app load, so avatars are shared across browsers instead of being tied to one browser's localStorage
- `POST /api/agent-photos/upload` saves the uploaded image file, updates the shared avatar map immediately, syncs the `agents.photo_url` column in Supabase, and returns the shared public URL
- `PUT /api/agent-photos/[id]` persists the selected avatar URL for a specific agent and syncs that value into Supabase
- `GET /api/agent-photos/file/[filename]` serves uploaded agent images dynamically from the local uploads folder so newly uploaded avatars work immediately without requiring a server restart
- The agent editor also updates the in-memory agent record immediately after upload so the new portrait appears before the modal is closed
- The agent editor now blocks Save while an avatar upload is still in progress, which prevents a just-selected image from being overwritten by an early save
- The editor header and preview both now use the just-uploaded image instead of the older stored avatar, so the user sees the selected portrait immediately
- Saving the agent now triggers an immediate authenticated `/api/state` sync so the new avatar becomes visible across browsers without waiting for the normal debounced persistence loop
- The last root-cause fix was replacing fragile `/uploads/agents/...` static URLs with dynamic `/api/agent-photos/file/...` URLs, because fresh runtime uploads were being written correctly but were not always served immediately by the production server
- Large avatar uploads are compressed client-side before upload so oversized images do not silently fail
- `next.config.mjs` now pins both `turbopack.root` and `outputFileTracingRoot` to this project so uploaded files under `public/uploads` are actually served correctly

### Cache / Refresh Behavior

- HTML responses are now served with `Cache-Control: no-store` via `next.config.mjs` so page shells pick up the latest build more reliably
- The top bar includes a hard refresh control that clears browser cache storage when possible and reloads the current URL with a cache-busting query string
- Static hashed Next assets still use their normal immutable caching behavior

## Editor Theme System

Pipeline and skill editing surfaces now use a shared editor theme layer from `src/styles/globals.css`.

### Shared Editor Tokens
- `.editor-theme` sets the overall surface and text colors
- `.editor-panel` and `.editor-panel-muted` provide card/container styles
- `.editor-input`, `.editor-textarea`, and `.editor-select` standardize field appearance
- `.editor-button-primary` and `.editor-button-secondary` standardize action buttons
- `.editor-tab` and `.editor-tab-active` keep tab styling consistent across editors

### Purpose
- Keeps `/pipeline/[id]`, `/skills/[id]`, and modal editing surfaces visually aligned with the rest of Mission Control
- Allows the same editor UI to switch cleanly between light mode and dark mode using the global theme variables

## Office Experience

- `src/components/office/OfficeFloor.tsx` now renders as a connected architectural floor plate with attached rooms and shared corridor spines
- The office layout is intentionally flatter and cleaner, closer to a signage-grade top-view floor map than floating cards
- Division names are rendered as one-line sign-style headers so labels stay clear of desks, chairs, and avatars and read more like room signage
- Room frames now use soft architectural edges and light borders instead of heavy dark outlines
- The office floor now carries a subtle light-gray tile grid across the full floor plate instead of isolated central path shapes
- Furniture and greenery are intentionally simplified toward a minimalist top-view office language instead of decorative icon shapes
- Active and paused agents are seated inside room seats that belong to their assigned division
- Idle agents roam through corridor paths using smoother long-form motion loops
- The right-side detail rail shows the selected room and live agent roster from shared app state

## Agent Cards

- `src/components/agents/AgentCard.tsx` now uses a stronger profile-card structure with a top rarity/header strip, clearer stats, and a unified action bar
- Cards keep the same agent actions as before: activate/pause, clone, remove, and open edit
- The card surface is now theme-aware and reads correctly in both light mode and dark mode
- Text, chip, and stat-tile contrast now follow global theme tokens instead of hardcoded dark-only values
- Visual emphasis is now split into:
  - identity block
  - completion/status block
  - runtime/output/workload stat tiles
  - current mission panel
  - consistent bottom action strip
- The styling stays within Mission Control’s current theme but pushes further toward “playable roster card” presentation

## Reliability Notes

- `src/components/ClientShell.tsx` is the hydration gate for the authenticated app shell:
  - it loads shared state from `/api/state`
  - it applies authenticated user context
  - it sets `appStateReady` only after the shared payload is resolved or explicitly failed
- `src/app/tasks/page.tsx`, `src/app/tasks/[id]/page.tsx`, and `src/app/outputs/page.tsx` now wait for `appStateReady` before rendering empty-state fallbacks, which prevents false “not found” or empty registry flashes during Supabase hydration
- `src/components/agents/IrisChat.tsx` now distinguishes between:
  - a usable deliverable
  - a coordination/status-only response
  - a provider failure
- If Iris returns only routing/correction language, the task is now marked `blocked` instead of pretending a real output exists
- If the chat request fails outright, the task is also marked `blocked` and stores the provider error in `handoffNotes`
- Tasks only create saved output artifacts when the response looks like a real deliverable, not when it is just boilerplate status language
- `src/app/tasks/[id]/page.tsx` now uses client-side router navigation after deletion instead of forcing a full-page reload
- `/api/chat` now returns provider-aware service statuses (for example `503` for unavailable AI runtime) instead of flattening availability problems into generic `500` errors
- `src/app/api/chat/route.ts` now also guards artifact-truth checks against missing artifact arrays, so a null-ish artifact payload no longer crashes the response assembly
- `/api/state` now performs optimistic concurrency checks using the last known `updatedAt` value and returns `409 Conflict` if a stale browser tab tries to overwrite a newer shared-state snapshot
- `src/components/ClientShell.tsx` now skips redundant `/api/state` writes when the serialized persistence snapshot has not actually changed
- `src/components/ClientShell.tsx` now sends top-level `statePatch` payloads for changed collections/settings instead of always posting the full snapshot, which reduces unnecessary sync volume even though the server still stores a merged shared snapshot
- `conversations` are intentionally excluded from shared-state hydration/sync for live chat reliability:
  - conversation message churn stays local during active chat updates so the server cannot overwrite in-progress intake UI
- `pendingBriefs` remain local-only for shared server sync:
  - the live briefing flow is restored from local Zustand persistence after remounts
  - this avoids reintroducing the old shared-state race where briefing could snap back to an earlier question
- Browser local persistence now stores a lighter snapshot:
  - artifact bodies, HTML, and source prompts are stripped
  - execution-step summaries are truncated
  - conversation history is reduced to the latest 6 trimmed messages
  Shared Supabase state remains the full source of truth for complete records
- `src/components/layout/TopBar.tsx` exposes a "Refresh latest app version" control that clears browser caches and reloads with a timestamped URL when a user gets stuck on an old build
- Deliverable quality is now evaluated before a task/output is treated as usable:
  - missing required sections
  - coordination/status boilerplate
  - weak deliverable structure
  will now fail the quality gate and keep the task blocked instead of pretending the output is ready

## Provider Runtime Model

- Provider settings are now treated as **user-scoped runtime preferences**, not a shared agency-wide secret store
- Each authenticated user keeps their own:
  - Ollama base URL
  - Ollama verification state and discovered models
  - Gemini API key, masked key, verification state, and preferred Gemini model
  - runtime routing preferences
- Runtime routing preferences now include:
  - primary runtime
  - fallback runtime
  - a `useGeminiForThinking` toggle for strategy/research/heavier reasoning tasks
- `src/app/api/state/route.ts` now:
  - loads provider settings from the authenticated user’s Supabase auth metadata
  - returns those user-scoped settings into the app state
  - saves updated provider settings back to that same authenticated user profile
- Shared agency state still stores:
  - agency settings
  - clients
  - tasks
  - outputs
  - conversations
  - activities/campaigns/memories bridge data
- Provider secrets are therefore no longer conceptually shared across all users of the workspace
- Raw Gemini keys are no longer persisted into browser localStorage snapshots; only masked/provider-safe values remain in browser persistence
- The authenticated server-side provider profile is now the trusted source for runtime selection

## Security Notes

- `SUPER_ADMIN_EMAIL` is now configurable through environment variables instead of being hardcoded as an unchangeable code constant
- `.env.local.example` now documents the required runtime variables, including `SUPER_ADMIN_EMAIL`
- Client-supplied brand/context values now pass through prompt-safety sanitization before they are injected into AI prompts or template interpolation
- The remaining planned security hardening items are:
  - deeper entity-level sync beyond the current core collections
  - fuller background execution infrastructure beyond request/response lifecycles

### Runtime Selection Rules

- Ollama is intended to be the primary default runtime
- Gemini is intended to be:
  - the fallback runtime
  - the preferred runtime for thinking-heavy deliverables when enabled and verified
- Thinking-heavy deliverables currently include:
  - strategy briefs
  - campaign strategy
  - research briefs
  - SEO audits
  - client briefs
  - KPI forecasts
- `src/app/api/chat/route.ts` now resolves the actual runtime from user-scoped provider settings instead of blindly trusting a hardcoded default provider
- If the selected runtime fails, the route now attempts the configured fallback runtime before returning an error
- `src/lib/server/ai.ts` now prioritizes content/social routing keywords before generic client-service phrases so requests like Instagram carousels route cleanly to `Echo` instead of being misclassified by words such as `client-ready`

### User Expectation

- Super admin can rely on their own local Ollama setup plus optional Gemini
- Other users are expected to install/run Ollama locally on their own machines if they want local-first generation
- Gemini only becomes active after the user saves and successfully verifies a valid API key from `/settings`

## QA Snapshot

- Authenticated super-admin flow has been verified through Supabase auth plus the `/users` admin APIs
- Shared state API has been verified with bearer-authenticated reads for:

## State Sync Model

- Shared state still keeps a full `mission_control_state.state` snapshot in Supabase for recovery and hydration
- The client no longer syncs only top-level slice replacements:
  - `agents`
  - `clients`
  - `missions`
  - `artifacts`
  - `conversations`
  are now tracked as **record-level entity deltas**
- `src/components/ClientShell.tsx` now computes:
  - per-record `upserts`
  - per-record `deletes`
  for the core entity collections
- `/api/state` now accepts:
  - `entityPatch`
  - `statePatch`
  - `updatedAt`
- `updatedAt` is used for optimistic concurrency, so stale tabs receive `409 Conflict` instead of silently overwriting newer shared state
- `src/lib/supabase/app-state.ts` now applies entity deltas to the snapshot and syncs those same deltas into relational tables
- `src/lib/supabase/relational-sync.ts` now supports targeted relational updates for:
  - agents
  - clients
  - missions/tasks
  - outputs
  - conversations/messages
  - knowledge assets for changed clients
- Non-entity bridge data still syncs as top-level patches:
  - `agencySettings`
  - `providerSettings`
  - `campaigns`
  - `activities`
  - `agentMemories`

## Task Execution Model

- A task can now execute through two paths:
  - immediate request-driven execution from `src/app/api/chat/route.ts`
  - explicit retry/resume execution from `src/app/api/tasks/[id]/execution/route.ts`
- The second path is important because it removes the “only during the original chat request” limitation
- Persisted execution data now lives in Supabase tables:
  - `workflow_instances`
  - `task_runs`
- `src/lib/server/task-execution.ts` is the server helper responsible for:
  - loading a saved task
  - loading its client context, knowledge assets, agents, pipelines, and skills
  - selecting the runtime from user-scoped provider settings
  - running autonomous execution
  - persisting workflow status and task-run records
  - saving/updating the output artifact row
- `src/lib/server/autonomous-task.ts` now supports execution hooks so the caller can persist:
  - phase start
  - activity completion
  - runtime/provider/model per activity
- `src/app/tasks/[id]/page.tsx` now reads persisted execution state and shows:
  - workflow status
  - current phase
  - progress
  - recent task-run records
  - retry/resume controls

## Skills And Pipelines In Runtime

- Skills and pipelines are not just editable config surfaces anymore; they are now part of the live execution path
- `src/app/api/chat/route.ts` loads:
  - pipelines from Supabase first, config fallback second
  - skills from Supabase first, config fallback second
- `src/app/pipeline/run/page.tsx` and `src/app/api/pipeline/run/route.ts` now launch the same tracked server-side task lifecycle as Iris:
  - the runner page creates a real `tasks` record
  - execution is queued through `/api/tasks/[id]/execution` semantics
  - live progress is polled from persisted `workflow_instances` + `task_runs`
  - the page no longer acts as a disconnected local pipeline engine
  - if no formal pipeline exists for the classified deliverable, the runner now falls back to **Direct Specialist Execution** instead of failing outright
- `src/lib/pipeline-execution.ts` is now a compatibility layer for:
  - route matching
  - client-field validation
  - pipeline task scaffolding for the runner UI
  - mapping persisted execution state back into runner task cards
  - deprecated client-side execution exports now throw immediately if anything still tries to use them
- `src/lib/server/autonomous-task.ts` now:
  - builds per-agent skill context
  - runs pipeline activities through the assigned role/agent mapping
  - records per-activity execution metadata for auditability
- Lead-skill injection is now deeper:
  - the top-ranked skill includes full instructions and output template
  - variable hints, richer checklist detail, workflow verification hints, and examples are exposed for primary skills instead of being reduced to tiny fragments
- This means the live generation path now actually uses:
  - pipeline definitions
  - assigned agent skills
  - client knowledge assets
  instead of only storing them in the database/UI
  - `/api/state`
  - `/api/admin/users`
- Current runtime caveat:
  - Iris/task generation still depends on at least one actually available AI provider
  - if Ollama is selected but not running, `/api/chat` returns a friendly failure and the task is blocked instead of silently pretending it completed

## Build & Deployment

```bash
cd /Users/moe/Desktop/Mission\ Control\ App
npm run dev  # Start development server
npm run build  # Production build
```

Access at: http://localhost:3000

## Git Status

- **40 commits ahead** of origin/main
- All changes committed locally
- Build passes with Next.js 16.2.1/Turbopack

## Constraints

- All configs stored as editable JSON in `src/config/`
- Agent definitions in `src/lib/agent-templates.ts`
- No hardcoded values — everything editable
- Skills follow Claude best practices format
- Build must pass before commits (`npm run build`)

- `IrisChat` now distinguishes between conversational chat and task intake: greetings, questions, and normal back-and-forth stay in the chat thread only, while explicit work requests open missions and persist deliverables as artifacts.
- The Iris chat shell self-heals stale conversation state: if the active conversation id points to a missing thread, it creates a fresh chat automatically before sending so messages never vanish into an invalid local session reference.
- `pendingBriefs` stay out of shared app-state sync and relational persistence:
  - they are recovered from local browser persistence after remounts
  - cross-device pending-brief recovery still needs a safer dedicated persistence design rather than the shared-state sync loop
- Execution queue state is no longer stored in an in-memory `Map`:
  - `src/lib/server/execution-queue.ts` persists queue lifecycle entries as `task_runs` with stage `execution-job`
  - `/api/tasks/[id]/execution` now reads that persisted job state back out for live polling
  - this makes queue/running/completed/failed status durable even if the UI refreshes
- Deliverable routing defaults are now centralized through `src/lib/deliverables.ts` compatibility helpers:
  - `agent-roles.ts` reads registry defaults instead of maintaining a fully separate lead/collaborator matrix
  - `task-channeling.ts` now derives lead, collaborator, and complexity defaults from the same deliverable registry and only keeps skill-pattern overrides
- `output-quality.ts` now adds semantic checks on top of structural section checks:
  - placeholder markers like `TBD`
  - unreplaced `{{variables}}`
  - bracketed template instructions such as `[Insert client name]`
  - underdeveloped sections on high-complexity deliverables
- The imported `mission-control-claude-genspark_ai_developer` variant was merged selectively rather than copied wholesale:
  - `ClientShell`, `TopBar`, and `AgentEditor` now memoize the Supabase browser client to avoid client-side hydration instability
  - the app shell now exposes a skip-to-content link and stronger focus-visible states on shared buttons
  - `/api/chat` now defaults to larger generation budgets and uses a lightweight conversational path for normal Iris chat
  - Ollama calls now use `/api/chat` with structured messages and a larger context window instead of flattening everything into one prompt string
  - the Nova media skill set was expanded with 16 detailed media-planning skills and corrected skill ids
  - server-side skill loading now merges Supabase-backed skills with full JSON config definitions, so missing config-only skills still appear in the UI/runtime and missing config skills are inserted into Supabase on later relational sync without overwriting edited DB rows
