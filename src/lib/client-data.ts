    description:
      'Global equine genomics company offering whole genome sequencing for horses, positioned at the intersection of human-grade genomic science and the equine industry.',
    missionStatement:
      `Unlock the full genetic story of every horse through whole genome sequencing and translate that science into simple, actionable insight. Core belief: "There's more to your horse than meets the eye."`,
    brandPromise:
      'One test for the entirety of a horse’s life, with updated results delivered as new variants and discoveries emerge.',
    targetAudiences:
      'Horse owners, breeders, trainers, bloodstock agents, veterinary professionals, and stables/farms that want better-informed decisions around health, heritage, performance, and breeding.',
    productsAndServices:
      'Arabian VGnome, Thoroughbred VGnome, Anglo-Arabian VGnome, VGenius bespoke consultative genomics, and paid genetic counseling.',
    usp:
      'World’s only equine DNA testing company using whole genome sequencing rather than panel testing; one-test-for-life model; breed-specific reporting; human-grade security and quality standards; in-house discovery and ongoing customer updates.',
    competitiveLandscape:
      'Competes against Etalon, Animal Genetics, UC Davis VGL, Plusvital/Equinome, Weatherbys Scientific, Texas A&M Animal Genetics Laboratory, and DNA My Horse. Victory differentiates through comprehensiveness, future-proofing, strategic depth, and stronger privacy/security posture.',
    keyMessages:
      `There’s more to your horse than meets the eye. One test for the entirety of your horse’s life. The world’s only whole genome sequencing for horses. Updated results pushed in hours. 20,000 genes. 5.5 million variants. 4 billion letters of DNA. We’re a discovery company, not just a testing company.`,
    toneOfVoice:
      'Scientific authority balanced with passionate accessibility. Confident, educational, emotionally connected to horse owners, action-oriented, and reassuring on privacy and security.',
    operationalDetails:
      'Accepts blood or hair samples globally. Typical turnaround is 30–40 working days with expedited options. Results delivered via secure online portal or email. DNA stored for 12 months post-testing. Major cards, money orders, and direct transfers accepted.',
    objectionHandling:
      'Higher upfront price is framed as long-term cost efficiency versus repeated panel retesting. Genetics is positioned as a decision-support tool rather than a deterministic verdict. Privacy concerns are addressed through strict confidentiality. Inconclusive findings are revisited as science evolves.',
    brandIdentityNotes:
      'Company abbreviation is VG. Product naming convention uses VGnome and VGenius with capital V and G. Signature creative data points: 20,000 genes, 5.5 million variants, 4 billion letters of DNA.',
    strategicPriorities:
      'Build category education around whole genome sequencing versus panel tests, reinforce premium one-test-for-life positioning, create breed-specific messaging, and arm sales/partner teams with stronger competitive comparison content.',
